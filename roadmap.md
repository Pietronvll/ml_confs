## `ml_confs` roadmap
- [x] Use (ordered) dict as a low level storage for configurations
- [x] Checks to be satisfied on the low level storage:
  - [x] No nested structure
  - [x] No duplicate keys
  - [x] Accepting only fixed typed:
    - `int`
    - `float`
    - `complex`?
    - `str`
    - `bool`
    - A `list` with _all_ of its elements types being any of the above
    - `null`
  - [x] Dynamically create dataclasses associated to this structure (so that the fields can be accessed with dot notation)
  - [x] Input - Output
    - [x] Load and save from/to `json` file
    - [x] Load and save from/to `yaml` file
    - [x] Create and export from/to ordinary `dict`
  - [x] Add a flag to make them `flax/jax` compatible
  - [ ] Add unit tests for `flax`
  - [ ] Update `readme.md`
  - [ ] Add the `**cfg` syntax
